Contribution Credits
====================

We maintain a `Citation File Format (CFF) <https://citation-file-format.github.io/>`_ file: 
`CITATION.cff <https://github.com/tgwoodcock/hdf5view/blob/main/CITATION.cff>`_ in order to
give credit to contributors and to provide metadata for citing hdf5view.

Under the ``Authors`` key, the initial author is listed first, followed by the current project host and maintainer, then 
the collective term ``The hdf5view Developers``, which includes all contributors to hdf5view as shown in the 
`contributors graph of the repository <https://github.com/tgwoodcock/hdf5view/graphs/contributors>`_.

If you are one of ``The hdf5view Developers`` and would prefer to be additionally named as an author, in ``CITATION.cff`` please
open an `issue <https://github.com/tgwoodcock/hdf5view/issues>`_.
